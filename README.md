# Black Title Bar for Chrome OS

 Do you prefer windowed sites as opposed to tabs?
 Are you tired of a white bar constantly shining in your face?

 If you answered yes to ANY of the above questions, then this is the Chrome Extension for you! 
  
 This extremely basic (and featureless) Chrome extension (made with jQuery) changes a windowed site's title bar from white to black. 

 The difference is night and day!
 ...for me at least.

Compatibility:

  * Chrome OS
  * Windows
  * macOS


NOTE:

  * Windowed sites on Windows and macOS may use OS system theme, rendering this extension useless.
  * Does NOT override custom theme color specified by site.
  * Does NOT theme Chrome OS system windows (settings, files, etc).
  * Requires "Developer Mode" to be enabled.

Installation:
  
  1. Unzip "Black-Title-Bar-Chrome-OS-main.zip" to it's own folder.
  2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`
  3. On the upper right, toggle on the "Developer Mode" switch (if not already enabled).
  4. A new menu will appear. Click the "Load unpacked" option found on the upper left.
  5. Browse to the location of the extension's folder and select it.
